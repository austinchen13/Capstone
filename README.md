E-commerce marketplaces can be daunting places to navigate for even the most experienced buyers and sellers. An overwhelming variety of products, in a range of conditions, subject to different shipping terms: all these factors can obscure the fair value of any given product. This complexity is evident even in a smaller sub-segment of online shopping, such as the market for used and vintage clothing â€“ a popular and growing area for e-commerce. Existing pricing tools in e-commerce marketplaces often price lower than expected for their own financial benefit. 

PriceProphet is a price suggestion tool for both buyers and sellers to help make shopping for clothing items more efficient. This tool will help users determine the fair market price for items up for sale in order to minimize wasted time and uncertainty for buyers and sellers alike. Our mission is to optimize e-commerce efficiency and promote price transparency for all.
